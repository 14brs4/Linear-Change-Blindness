- Change Static (unlike Observer Motion) to start at the halfway point of the motion trials. Spheres are too far away.
- Issues if a sphere is selected too early:
    - CSV does not populate "Before Change" and "After Change" columns with values
    - Ticking sounds stop prematurely

DONE!
- Create blocks, Set blocks to each have one type of motion each (Observer Motion, Object Motion, Static Motion)
    - Experimenter sets order beforehand: Block 1 - Dropdown of options, Block 2 - Dropdown of options, etc.

DONE!
- Remove Rotation-related Columns from CSV: Attendant Ring, Ring Configuration, Ring States, etc.

- See about using the other room.

- Look at adding HTC headset/controller support instead of Oculus (lighter on the head)

- Change Hue Change to be 0-360 instead of 0-1 (degrees on colour wheel)

- Make Orientation trials not crash the program (Fix or remove).
