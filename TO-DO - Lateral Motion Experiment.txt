Proper distance: Start Point 6.

Starting Z position:

- Spheres, same FOV -- Much smaller size and radius. Should be about 4m away -- meaning you close half the distance when you walk towards them.
- Make a training block: No spheres visible, just to get participants used to walking. Each step should be approx. in the middle of each square -- 0.5m apart.
	- Optional: Make the squares they should walk a different colour: "You should be at the end of the coloured squares when you are finished your steps."
- Make a training block: No spheres visible, just to get participants used to walking. Each step should be approx. in the middle of each square -- 0.5m apart.



Question: How do we want the blocks split?
    - Just two types: Motion and Static?
    - Or 4 types: Both Moving, Inner Moving, Outer Moving, Static?

- Change Static (unlike Observer Motion) to start at the halfway point of the motion trials. Spheres are too far away.
- Issues if a sphere is selected too early:
    - CSV does not populate "Before Change" and "After Change" columns with values
    - Ticking sounds stop prematurely

DONE!
- Create blocks, Set blocks to each have one type of motion each (Observer Motion, Object Motion, Static Motion)
    - Experimenter sets order beforehand: Block 1 - Dropdown of options, Block 2 - Dropdown of options, etc.

DONE!
- Remove Rotation-related Columns from CSV: Attendant Ring, Ring Configuration, Ring States, etc.

- See about using the other room.

- Look at adding HTC headset/controller support instead of Oculus (lighter on the head)

- Change Hue Change to be 0-360 instead of 0-1 (degrees on colour wheel)

- Make Orientation trials not crash the program (Fix or remove).
